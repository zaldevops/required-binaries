.SH NAME
.PP
helm\-package \- package a chart directory into a chart archive


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm package [CHART\_PATH] [...] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command packages a chart into a versioned chart archive file. If a path
is given, this will look at that path for a chart (which must contain a
Chart.yaml file) and then package that directory.

.PP
Versioned chart archives are used by Helm package repositories.

.PP
To sign a chart, use the '\-\-sign' flag. In most cases, you should also
provide '\-\-keyring path/to/secret/keys' and '\-\-key keyname'.

.PP
$ helm package \-\-sign ./mychart \-\-key mykey \-\-keyring \~/.gnupg/secring.gpg

.PP
If '\-\-keyring' is not specified, Helm usually defaults to the public keyring
unless your environment is otherwise configured.
