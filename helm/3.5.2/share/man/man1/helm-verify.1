.SH NAME
.PP
helm\-verify \- verify that a chart at the given path has been signed and is valid


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm verify PATH [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Verify that the given chart has a valid provenance file.

.PP
Provenance files provide cryptographic verification that a chart has not been
tampered with, and was packaged by a trusted provider.

.PP
This command can be used to verify a local chart. Several other commands provide
'\-\-verify' flags that run the same validation. To generate a signed package, use
the 'helm package \-\-sign' command.
