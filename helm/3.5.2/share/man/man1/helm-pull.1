.SH NAME
.PP
helm\-pull \- download a chart from a repository and (optionally) unpack it in local directory


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm pull [chart URL | repo/chartname] [...] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Retrieve a package from a package repository, and download it locally.

.PP
This is useful for fetching packages to inspect, modify, or repackage. It can
also be used to perform cryptographic verification of a chart without installing
the chart.

.PP
There are options for unpacking the chart after download. This will create a
directory for the chart and uncompress into that directory.

.PP
If the \-\-verify flag is specified, the requested chart MUST have a provenance
file, and MUST pass the verification process. Failure in any part of this will
result in an error, and the chart will not be saved locally.
