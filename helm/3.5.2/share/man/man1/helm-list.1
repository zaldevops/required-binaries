.PP
helm\-list \- list releases


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBhelm list [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command lists all of the releases for a specified namespace (uses current namespace context if namespace not specified).

.PP
By default, it lists only releases that are deployed or failed. Flags like
'\-\-uninstalled' and '\-\-all' will alter this behavior. Such flags can be combined:
'\-\-uninstalled \-\-failed'.

.PP
By default, items are sorted alphabetically. Use the '\-d' flag to sort by
release date.

.PP
If the \-\-filter flag is provided, it will be treated as a filter. Filters are
regular expressions (Perl compatible) that are applied to the list of releases.
Only items that match the filter will be returned.

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ helm list \-\-filter 'ara[a\-z]+'

.PP
If no results are found, 'helm list' will exit 0, but with no output (or in
the case of no '\-q' flag, only headers).

.PP
By default, up to 256 items may be returned. To limit this, use the '\-\-max' flag.
Setting '\-\-max' to 0 will not return all results. Rather, it will return the
server's default, which may be much higher than 256. Pairing the '\-\-max'
flag with the '\-\-offset' flag allows you to page through results.
